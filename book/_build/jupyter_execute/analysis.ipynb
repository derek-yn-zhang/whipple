    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a systematic data cleaning pipeline in Python. Administrative variables (patient identifiers, free-text fields) and clinically irrelevant timestamp variables were removed. Variables were selected based on clinical relevance to the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Height and weight were standardized to metric units. Binary composite outcomes were created when individual outcomes represented different severity levels of the same clinical event. Postoperative sepsis and septic shock were combined into a single \"any sepsis\" outcome, as both represent points on a severity continuum of the same infectious process. Superficial, deep, and organ/space surgical site infections were combined into a binary SSI indicator. This approach improved statistical power while maintaining clinical interpretability. Component variables were dropped after derivation to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final outcome variables were:\n",
    "- Surgical length of stay\n",
    "- Any postoperative sepsis occurrence\n",
    "- Any surgical site infection\n",
    "- Readmission related to primary procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictor variables included patient demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical characteristics (ASA classification, functional status, BMI), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension), preoperative laboratory values (albumin, BUN, creatinine, sodium, bilirubin, hematocrit, WBC, INR, PTT), procedure-related variables (CPT code, incisional negative pressure wound therapy use), and administrative factors (primary payor status, discharge destination). Categorical predictors with sparse categories were consolidated. Variables with natural ordering (ASA classification, functional status) were coded as ordered categorical to preserve clinical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We excluded variables with more than 20% missing data, as this level of missingness compromises statistical power and imputation reliability. For categorical variables, balance was assessed to ensure adequate representation across categories. We distinguished between truly categorical variables (including nominal text categories and low-cardinality integer codes) and continuous count variables based on their statistical properties. Integer variables were treated as categorical only if they had 10 or fewer unique values or if fewer than 10% of observations had unique values, indicating inherent categorization rather than a continuous scale. This approach correctly identified ordinal ratings and categorical codes while preserving genuine count variables for appropriate statistical handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "For variables classified as categorical or quasi-categorical, we assessed balance using the second-largest class rather than the smallest category. This criterion retained variables with long tails of rare events that could be collapsed during modeling while excluding those lacking adequate representation in clinically meaningful categories. Variables where the second-largest class had fewer than 10 observations were dropped. Continuous count variables were exempt from balance assessment, as their information content derives from the full distribution rather than discrete category sizes."

    "## Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate predictor variables were screened using two complementary variable selection approaches to identify covariates associated with each outcome. The treatment variable (incisional negative pressure wound therapy) was forced into all models regardless of selection results, as it represented the primary exposure of interest. All other variables underwent selection as potential confounders or effect modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Univariate Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Each candidate covariate was assessed using univariate statistical tests. Predictors were classified as continuous or categorical based on data type. Continuous predictors were analyzed as numeric values, while categorical predictors included both predefined categories and string-type variables converted to categorical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of statistical test was determined by the type of predictor and outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous outcome, continuous predictor: Pearson correlation.\n",
    "- Continuous outcome, categorical predictor: Welch's t-test for binary predictors; one-way ANOVA for predictors with more than two categories.\n",
    "- Categorical outcome, continuous predictor: Welch's t-test for binary outcomes; one-way ANOVA for outcomes with more than two categories.\n",
    "- Categorical outcome, categorical predictor: Fisher's exact test for 2×2 tables with small expected counts; otherwise, Pearson's chi-square test. Categories with fewer than five observations were combined or excluded to ensure stable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations with missing outcome data were excluded. Missing values within predictor groups were handled by pairwise deletion during testing. Variables with fewer than two unique values were omitted. Covariates yielding a p-value less than 0.1 in univariate testing were identified as candidates for multivariable modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elastic Net Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As a complementary approach, we used elastic net regularization for variable selection. This method handles multicollinearity by shrinking correlated predictors and automatically performs variable selection by setting coefficients to zero. For binary outcomes, we applied logistic regression with elastic net penalty (L1 ratio = 0.5, balancing Lasso and Ridge penalties). For count outcomes, we applied elastic net regression with the same L1 ratio. Regularization parameters were chosen via 5-fold cross-validation to optimize prediction. Covariates with non-zero coefficients after regularization were identified as candidates for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeated k-Fold Stability Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "To further assess the robustness of elastic net selection, we implemented a repeated k-fold procedure. For each outcome, the dataset was split into k folds multiple times, elastic net was applied in each fold, and the proportion of folds in which each variable was selected was recorded. Variables selected in more than 50% of folds were considered relatively stable predictors. Additionally, the distribution of their coefficients across folds was summarized to characterize variability and reliability. This approach allows identification of covariates that consistently contribute to prediction, reducing reliance on a single cross-validation split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consensus Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the most robust set of covariates, we also planned to fit models using only variables selected by both univariate testing and elastic net (consensus approach). This conservative strategy retained only predictors showing evidence of association through two different methods. When no variables were selected by both methods, the consensus model included only the treatment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of test performed and associated p-value or regularization coefficient were recorded for transparency. This dual approach ensured that predictor selection was not dependent on a single statistical method, allowing assessment of whether treatment effects remained consistent across different covariate adjustment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Size and Model Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "We determined the maximum number of predictors that could be reliably estimated given our sample size, following established guidelines for regression modeling. For binary outcomes, we applied the criterion of 10 events in the minority class per variable (Peduzzi et al., 1996). For count outcomes, we used a more conservative threshold of 15 observations per variable to account for the additional variance and reduced information content per observation in overdispersed count data. The treatment variable counted toward this limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When variable selection methods identified more candidate predictors than the calculated maximum, we retained only the top N variables to remain within sample size guidelines. For univariate selection, we retained variables with the smallest p-values. For elastic net selection, we retained variables with the largest absolute coefficients. This approach balanced the information provided by variable selection methods with the statistical requirement for adequate sample size relative to model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separation and Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to model fitting, we assessed all selected variables for quasi-perfect separation—patterns where certain predictor levels were associated with near-complete homogeneity in the outcome. Separation was defined as 95% or more observations in a predictor level falling into a single outcome category. While separation is particularly problematic for logistic regression, where it can cause coefficient estimates to diverge toward infinity, it is less catastrophic for count models. We proceeded with model fitting using standard maximum likelihood estimation regardless of separation patterns. When models failed to converge despite appropriate sample size considerations, we concluded the data were insufficient to support that particular covariate structure and report this limitation explicitly rather than employing alternative estimation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Fitting Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "For each outcome, we attempted to fit four models to comprehensively assess treatment effects and potential confounding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unadjusted model**: Treatment variable only, using all available observations with complete outcome data\n",
    "2. **Univariate-adjusted model**: Treatment plus covariates selected by univariate testing\n",
    "3. **Elastic net-adjusted model**: Treatment plus covariates selected by elastic net regularization, with repeated k-fold stability assessment to identify robust predictors\n",
    "4. **Consensus-adjusted model**: Treatment plus covariates selected by both methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy allowed comparison of unadjusted and adjusted estimates to evaluate confounding. When adjusted models failed to converge due to separation or other numerical issues, unadjusted estimates provided important context about marginal treatment associations, with appropriate caveats about potential unmeasured or unmeasurable confounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Postoperative sepsis, surgical site infection, and readmission related to the primary procedure were treated as binary outcomes. Prior to modeling, continuous predictors were standardized to facilitate comparison of effect sizes and improve convergence. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded with the first category dropped as reference, and rare categories (fewer than 5 observations) were excluded to avoid sparse cells. Observations with missing data in either the outcome or selected predictors were removed via listwise deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Count Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Surgical length of stay was measured in days and treated as a count outcome. Observed variance substantially exceeded the mean, indicating overdispersion; therefore, negative binomial regression was used rather than Poisson regression. Continuous predictors were not standardized for count models, as negative binomial regression coefficients have natural interpretability on the log scale. Categorical encoding and missing data handling followed the same protocol as binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence was assessed for all fitted models. Treatment effects and covariate associations were reported as odds ratios for binary outcomes and incidence rate ratios for length of stay, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values. By fitting both unadjusted and adjusted models with different selection strategies, we evaluated whether the estimated treatment effect remained consistent across reasonable modeling choices and assessed the degree of confounding by measured covariates. This approach provided evidence for the robustness of findings to covariate adjustment decisions when models converged successfully, and transparently documented limitations when sample size or data structure precluded stable parameter estimation. When adjusted models failed to converge but unadjusted models succeeded, we reported unadjusted estimates with explicit acknowledgment of their limitations regarding causal inference."

    "### Overview of Variable Selection and Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed a systematic two-stage approach to variable selection and model fitting. First, we applied two independent variable selection methods—univariate testing (p < 0.1) and elastic net regularization (L1 ratio = 0.5, 5-fold cross-validation)—to identify candidate predictors for each outcome. For elastic net, we additionally implemented a repeated k-fold procedure to assess selection stability, recording the proportion of folds in which each variable was selected and the distribution of its coefficients. Variables selected consistently across folds (>50%) were considered more robust predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we determined the maximum number of covariates that could be reliably estimated given our sample size, using established guidelines: 10 events per variable for binary outcomes (Peduzzi et al., 1996) and 15 observations per variable for count outcomes, the latter being more conservative to account for increased variance in count data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When either selection method identified more variables than the sample size threshold permitted, we retained only the top N variables ranked by statistical strength (smallest p-values for univariate, largest absolute coefficients for elastic net). The treatment variable (incisional negative pressure wound therapy, INPWT) was included in all models regardless of selection and counted toward the variable limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempted to fit four models per outcome to assess treatment effects and confounding: (1) unadjusted (treatment only), (2) univariate selection (treatment + univariate covariates), (3) elastic net selection (treatment + elastic net covariates), and (4) consensus (treatment + variables selected by both methods). Comparison of unadjusted and adjusted estimates allowed assessment of confounding. When adjusted models failed to converge despite appropriate sample size considerations, we reported unadjusted estimates with appropriate caveats about unmeasured or unmeasurable confounding.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "INPWT showed a significant protective association with postoperative sepsis in all models (unadjusted and adjusted were identical as no covariates were selected), with a 64% reduction in odds (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 – 0.85, p = 0.019). This effect was robust and was not confounded by measured patient characteristics that could be included given sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "For surgical length of stay, only the adjusted univariate model converged, showing a 9% reduction in expected stay (IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 – 1.05, p = 0.190) that did not reach statistical significance. The unadjusted model failed to converge, likely due to extreme overdispersion in the complete dataset, preventing direct assessment of confounding. The adjusted model identified discharge destination and diabetes status as the strongest predictors of length of stay. Repeated k-fold elastic net highlighted Serum Creatinine as the most stable predictor, though the model failed to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SSI and readmission, unadjusted analyses showed null findings (SSI: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 – 2.23, p = 0.880; Readmission: OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.40 – 2.41, p = 0.959). Adjusted models could not be fit due to perfect separation in selected covariates or insufficient events. The null unadjusted estimates with point estimates near 1.0 provide no suggestion that adjustment would reveal substantial treatment benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discharge disposition and diabetes status were the strongest determinants of length of stay in adjusted analysis. Discharge to non-home settings was associated with 33-42% longer stays, and absence of insulin-dependent diabetes was associated with 27% shorter stays compared to insulin-dependent diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size limitations precluded definitive adjusted analysis of SSI (26 events) and readmission (23 events) outcomes. The small event counts relative to the number of candidate predictors resulted in models that could not be fit due to separation issues. For surgical length of stay, elastic net selection identified 1 stable variable, but convergence failed. Paradoxically, the treatment-only model also failed to converge, highlighting significant overdispersion challenges in count outcome modeling with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings underscore the importance of sample size considerations in surgical outcomes research and the value of attempting both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. When unadjusted models converge, they provide important context even when adjustment fails. The SSI and readmission results demonstrate that null unadjusted findings, while limited by potential confounding, can still inform clinical decision-making and future research planning. Future studies of these endpoints may require larger samples, alternative analytical approaches such as penalized regression methods specifically designed to handle separation and overdispersion, propensity score methods to reduce dimensionality, or Bayesian approaches that can incorporate prior information to stabilize estimates with sparse data.\n"
