# Overview

## Background

Pancreatic surgery carries substantial risk of postoperative complications, particularly those related to wound healing and surgical site integrity. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (INPWT) has emerged as a potential intervention to improve wound healing outcomes by promoting tissue perfusion, reducing edema, and protecting the surgical site from external contamination.

## Study Objective

This analysis evaluates the effect of INPWT on surgical site outcomes and wound healing in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Specifically, we assess whether INPWT reduces:

- **Surgical site infections** (superficial, deep, and organ/space SSI)
- **Systemic inflammatory complications** (postoperative sepsis and septic shock)
- **Recovery time** (surgical length of stay as a proxy for wound healing trajectory)
- **Procedure-related readmissions** (readmissions related to the primary procedure as an indicator of delayed complications)

## Study Design and Data

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 165 pancreatic surgery patients. Patients either received INPWT or standard wound care. We examined a comprehensive set of postoperative outcomes and adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, procedural characteristics, and preoperative laboratory values.

The analysis employed rigorous data cleaning procedures and multiple variable selection strategies (univariate testing and elastic net regularization) to identify confounders and assess the robustness of treatment effects across different modeling approaches.

## Clinical Significance

Pancreatic surgery patients face elevated risks of wound-related complications due to factors including malnutrition, diabetes, immunosuppression, and the technical complexity of the procedures. Interventions that improve wound healing could substantially reduce morbidity, healthcare costs, and patient suffering. This analysis aims to provide evidence on whether INPWT represents an effective strategy for improving surgical site outcomes in this high-risk population.
